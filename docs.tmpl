In Literature
-------------

Cheetah is covered in [Python in a Nutshell](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596001886/ref=pd_sim_b_2/002-9262270-4252038?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance)
by Alex Martelli.  Alex writes on the Cheetah list: "Nutshell
readers looking for templating engines will be tempted by my ultra-brief
coverage enough to come visit the Cheetah site and get stunned.  Indeed, I'm
impressed enough that I plan to cover _only_ Cheetah as the one tool for any
serious templating need."


It is also introduced in the New Riders book [Python Web Programming](http://www.informit.com/title/0735710902)
by Steve Holden.  Steve writes "Although the software is still in beta at the
time of writing, it is already stable and easy to use either with or without
Webware. It looks as though Cheetah will be useful to many web projects, as
well as any others that need flexible template substitution of a general
nature."  Published Jan 8th, 2002.
