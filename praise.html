    replacing it with Cheetah and it's been a great success. I initially learned
    of Cheetah from Sam Ruby as he is using to write his own blogging
    software. The transformations are fast and Cheetah, to me, has struck just
    the right balance, sticking to adding features needed for templating and
    avoiding the tempation to become a full-blown language on it's own, instead
    deferring to Python when appropriate. ... Cheetah definitely passes by first
    cut utility test, in adding Cheetah to RESTLog my code got smaller and
    cleaner.&#8221;</span>

    J2EE stack (JBoss / JPublish (used Velocity for templating)) over to a
    fastcgi-based web publishing system with Cheetah as the star. Site-wide,
    we're currently serving an average of 68K pages (198K 'hits') per day, with
    the Cheetah'd pages doing more than 65% of that traffic. Our web traffic has
    doubled in the past 6 months, and that growth curve shows no sign of slowing
    down.<br /><br />

    We have found Cheetah to be a gloriously flexible and powerful
    technology. Functions within templates allowed us to do far more elegant
    structured programming at the document level. Being able to use templates as
    python classes, importing constants and other goodies directly from our
    middleware python code really lets them act as first class code members
    instead of an ugly lesser citizen.&#8221;</span>
