Contributing to Cheetah
========================

Cheetah is the work of many volunteers. If you use Cheetah, share your experiences, tricks, customizations, and frustrations. 
Please join the [mailing list](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cheetahtemplate-discuss).

Fork Me!
--------
Community Cheetah is hosted by [GitHub](http://www.github.com) which encourages forking of projects in order
to facilitate truly distributed and decentralized development. That is not to say that Community Cheetah is
"decentralized" per s&eacute; but rather it's ready for community involvement from the get-go! To get started
with contributing to Community Cheetah, it's a good idea to clone the "central" Git repo [here](http://github.com/rtyler/cheetah).

Development Process
-------------------
The typical development workflow for Community Cheetah revolves around two primary branches **maint** and **next**.
The **next** branch is where development planned for the next release of Community Cheetah is. The **maint** branch
on the otherhand is where backported fixes and patches will be applied for the *current* release of Community Cheetah
will go, it's common for a patch to be applied to **maint** and **next** at the same time.


Bug reports and patches
-----------------------

If you have stubmled across a bug or have an improvement to suggest in Cheetah please consider reporting 
the issue into Community Cheetah's [bug tracker](http://bugs.communitycheetah.org) or emailing the 
[mailing list](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cheetahtemplate-discuss).

Please try to include the following bits of information:

* A description of what you were trying to do, and what happened (i.e. reproduction steps)
* Any and all tracebacks or compiler errors
* The version of Cheetah you're using
* The version of Python you're using
* The operating system you're running Cheetah on
* Any other pieces of information you might think are relevant

Example sites and tutorials
---------------------------

If you're developing a website with Cheetah, please send a link to the email list so we can keep track of Cheetah sites. Also, if you discover new and interesting ways to use Cheetah please share your experience and write a quick tutorial about your technique.


Test cases
----------

Cheetah is packaged with a regression testing suite that is run with each new release to ensure that everything is working as expected and that recent changes haven't broken anything. The test cases are in the Cheetah.Tests module. If you find a reproduceable bug please consider writing a test case that will pass only when the bug is fixed. Send any new test cases to the email list with the subject-line "new test case for Cheetah."
