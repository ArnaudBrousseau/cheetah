Community Cheetah
=================

Community Cheetah is an active fork of the [Cheetah Template](http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/) engine.
The Cheetah Templating engine is a fully [Python](http://www.python.org)-powered templating engine
that can output or generate practically **any** text-based format (including Python itself!)

The primary motivations for the Community Cheetah fork is to maintain *active* development outside of 
the currently-stale [Cheetah CVS tree](http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=cvs&group_id=28961). Community Cheetah
isn't meant to diverge from the main goals of Cheetah: speed, ease of use and stability, but rather Community
Cheetah is meant to reinvirgorate the community surrounding Cheetah and provide **monthly** releases incorporating
patches and improvements to the engine.

Cheetah already has a large and active user community, and there are a number of products built with Cheetah in the
Fortune 500, as well startups in Silicon Valley (like [reddit](http://www.reddit.com))
